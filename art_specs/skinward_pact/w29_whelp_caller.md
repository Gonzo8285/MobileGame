## Validation checklist

- [ ] Reads as Gallowfell — coherent with reference-sheet tiles
- [ ] Faction palette holds — bark-brown accent, not red-brown or olive
- [ ] Druidic-with-phyrexian-undertones present, no explicit gore
- [ ] Composition — focal figure (or environment) dominates, atmospheric depth
- [ ] Brushwork — reads as oil painting, not 3D render or anime
- [ ] Thumbnail-readable at 200×280 px
- [ ] PEGI 12 compliant — no severed limbs / exposed organs / blood pools
- [ ] **APPROVED** — Paul's signature once landed
